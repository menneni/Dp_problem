Because it is the Internet Age, but also it is a recession, the Comptroller

of the town of Jurgensville has decided to publish the prices of every item

on every menu of every restaurant in town, all in a single CSV file

(Jurgensville is not quite up to date with modern data serialization

methods).  In addition, the restaurants of Jurgensville also offer Value

Meals, which are groups of several items, at a discounted price.  The

Comptroller has also included these Value Meals in the file.  The file's

format is:



for lines that define a price for a single item:

restaurant ID, price, item label



for lines that define the price for a Value Meal (there can be any number of

items in a value meal)

restaurant ID, price, item 1 label, item 2 label, ...



All restaurant IDs are integers, all item labels are lower case letters and

underscores, and the price is a decimal number.





Because you are an expert software engineer, you decide to write a program

that accepts the town's price file, and a list of item labels that someone

wants to eat for dinner, and outputs the restaurant they should go to, and

the total price it will cost them.  It is okay to purchase extra items, as

long as the total cost is minimized.
